    <li>4 ounces cubed processed cheese food</li>
    <li>2 fluid ounces milk</li>
    <li>Â¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. </li>
    <li>Place a saucepan over medium-low heat. Combine the cheese food, milk, and pepper in the saucepan; cook until the cheese has melted, stirring frequently. Stir in the drained macaroni until evenly coated. </li>
